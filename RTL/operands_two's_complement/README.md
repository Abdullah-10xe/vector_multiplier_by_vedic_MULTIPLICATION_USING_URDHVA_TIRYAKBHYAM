For operand A set parameter select_operand =0  and For operand B select_operand ==1
Supporting Precisions 8,16,32  (00,01,10)  11 is deafult 8 bit 
This moudle is design for compile with  Vector multiplier(VEDIC MULTIPLIER USING URDHVA-TIRYAKBHYAM) with precision 32 16 8 
Modified Tow's complement circuit is used (using Prefix calculations )
